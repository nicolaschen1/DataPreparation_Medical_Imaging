# DataPreparation_Medical_Imaging

## About
Python scripts to prepare data for blood cells detection.

## Description
Data preparation is important to use machine learning. In this project, I used the Faster R-CNN algorithm from [keras-frcnn](https://github.com/kbardool/keras-frcnn) for Object Detection.
From this [dataset](https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset), I developed two Python scripts to generate CSV file and images of blood cells with color boxes for recognition of abnormalities in blood cells on medical imaging.

## Data Preparation

Export.py: it creates the file "test.csv" with all data needed: filename, class_name, x1,y1,x2,y2
Plot.py: it plots the boxes for each image and save it in a new directory




## Screenshots
Some examples of images generated by these scripts:

## Faster R-CNN
From images of blood cells generated by these python scripts, these images can be used in the Faster R-CNN from [keras-frcnn](https://github.com/kbardool/keras-frcnn).
